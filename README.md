## React Suspense
[Streaming a component](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/streaming#streaming-a-component)

React Suspense lets you specify a fallback React element that is shown while the main component is loading. In this example, the fallback is a UI skeleton.

In the actual component, instead of immediately rendering with props, we can perform business logic or data fetching inside it. While that data is loading, the fallback (skeleton) is displayed. Once the data arrives, React swaps the fallback for the actual UI component.

This process—where parts of the UI stream in and replace placeholders—is referred to as **streaming** in React.
